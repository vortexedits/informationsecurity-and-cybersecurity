## 🔑 Authentication Methods

- Knowledge-based: Passwords, PINs
- *Possession-based:* Smart cards, OTP tokens  
- *Inherence-based:* Biometrics (fingerprints, face ID)  
- *Multifactor Authentication (MFA):* Combination of 2 or more above  
- *Single Sign-On (SSO):* One-time login across multiple systems (e.g., Google or Microsoft SSO)

## 🔓 Authorization Models
DAC (Discretionary Access Control): Owner decides who can access

MAC (Mandatory Access Control): Access based on classification 1

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Permissions assigned to roles

- ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control): Access based on condition

#Example:

An "HR Manager" role can view employee data, while "Employee" role can only view their own profil

#Best Practices

strong, unique unique passwords.

Apply MFA wherever possible.

Review role-based permissions regularly.

Log all authentication and access events.
