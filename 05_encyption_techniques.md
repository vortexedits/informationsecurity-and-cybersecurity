# 🔐 Encryption Techniques — 05

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand cryptography basics  
- Differentiate between symmetric and asymmetric encryption  
- Learn hashing and digital signature concepts  

---

## 🧩 Cryptography
Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communications using codes to ensure confidentiality,integrity and authentication.

---

## 🔸 Symmetric Encryption
- Uses one key for both encryption and decryption.  
- Fast, suitable for bulk data encryption.  

---

## 🔹 Asymmetric Encryption
- Uses two keys: public key (for encryption) and private key (for decryption).  
- Used for secure key exchange and digital communication.  

---

## 🔑 Hashing
- Converts data into a fixed-length string.  
- Used for secure data integrity verification.#Hashing
- One-way process cannot be reversed.
- Used for password storage and integrity checking.
- Common Algorithms: SHA-256, HDS (deprecated)
## Digital Signatures and Certificates
- Ensure authenticity and non-repudiation.
- A digital signature uses private key to sign data and public kay to verify.
- Certificates (X.509) are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) for trust verification (used in HTTPS).
  ## Example:
  When visiting https://bank.com
- browser verifies certificate signed by CA to ensure authenticity.
