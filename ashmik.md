Security vs Cybersecurity
|**informationsecurity**
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Protection **of all forms of information** (digital or physical) from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. |
| Broader â€“ includes data in any form (printed, spoken, written, or electronic). |
| Ensure Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of information, regardless of medium. |
| Data protection (physical & digital). |

* - Paper documents
 
*Cyber security*
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|Protection of **digital assets, systems, networks, and data** from cyberattacks originating through the internet or  other digital means.
| Narrower - focuses specifically on *digital and network-based threats*
| Protect *computers, networks, servers, and data* from online attacks, breaches and malware.
| system and network
 defense (digital only)

*Simplified understanding*
- *Information security* = Protecting all kinds of information
- Digital + Physical
- *Cybersecurity* = Protecting digital assets
- Internet + Network systems

## Example comparison
| *Situation*                                        | *Infosec View*                                                | *Cybersecurity view*
| ---------------------------------------------        | ------------------------------------------------------------    | --------------------------------------------------- 
| A hacker steals customer database from a website     | Concerned about *loss of confidentiality* of customer data    | Concerned about *how the hacker breached the server* and *network vulnerabilities*
| Employee prints confidential data and leaks it       | *Handled under Infosec* (physical data breach)                | Not considered a *cyber* issue (no digital attack involved)
