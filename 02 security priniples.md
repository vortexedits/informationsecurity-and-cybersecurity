# Security Principles

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand the CIA Triad and its importance.
- Explain Risk, Privacy, and Accountability.
- Relate security principles to real-world cyber incidents.

## CIA Triad
- The CIA Triad forms the foundation of information security.
- Each element ensures that information remains safe and trustworthy.

| Element | Description | Example |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Confidentiality | Ensures data is accessible only to authorized users. | Encrypting files, using passwords, access control lists. |
| Integrity | Ensures data is accurate, consistent, and not tampered with. | Using hashing, digital signatures, checksums. |
| Availability | Ensures systems and data are available when needed. | Redundant servers, backups, DDoS protection. |

## Key Concepts
- Data breaches often occur when one or more CIA principles are compromised.
- Balance is key â€” too much focus on one (e.g., availability) can weaken another (e.g., confidentiality).
